## Small Model
Small Model is very important in many scenarios, such as mobile phones and autopilots. In this section, we compare some various methods about training a small model to generate a baseline of Chinese NLP tasks. And we hope to get a well standard for measuring the ability of small models. 

### Small Model Trained Directly

### Model Compression

#### Knowledge Distillation

#### Quantization

#### Pruning
